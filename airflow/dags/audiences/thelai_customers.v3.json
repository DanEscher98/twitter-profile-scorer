  "lowSignals": [
    "Pure clinical roles: MD, fellow, resident focused solely on patient care with no research mention",

    "Epidemiologists or public health researchers without clear qualitative vs quantitative indication",
    "Faculty in adjacent fields (e.g., gastroenterology, nephrology) studying underserved populations or access issues",
    "Research coordinators/specialists at academic institutions - likely supports qualitative work but role unclear",

  ],
  "domainContext": "Target profiles conduct or support human-subjects research requiring: participant recruitment and tracking, interview/focus group scheduling, transcription services (including multilingual), IRB/HIPPA compliance documentation, secure storage for sensitive qualitative data, and team collaboration on coding/analysis. They study populations and phenomena through direct human interaction - interviews, observations, focus groups. Include research coordinators/specialists at universities or academic hospitals who directly support qualitative studies.",
  "notes": "null = actionable lead with ambiguous fit (worth manual review or nurture campaign). Previous version marked these as false, losing potential customers. Key null cases: epidemiologists, clinical faculty studying populations, research coordinators. Empty/vague bios are now false (no signal to act on). [Final System Prompt: 840 tokens]"
